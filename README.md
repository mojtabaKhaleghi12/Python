The Caesar Cipher algorithm is one of the encryption algorithms.

This algorithm works by replacing each letter in the English alphabet with its shifted counterpart. That is, if the shift value is 3, the letter A will be replaced with D.

Now, if there are multiple letters in a sentence, you should increase the shift value by one unit for each subsequent letter.
